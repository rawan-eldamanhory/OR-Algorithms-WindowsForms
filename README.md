# Operations Research Toolkit (Windows Forms)

This project is a **Windows Forms desktop application** that implements several core **Operations Research (OR)** methods with a graphical user interface.

## Features
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Graphical Method
- Single Queue Model
- Multiple Queue Model
- Simplex Method

## Application Flow
- The main window displays buttons for each OR method.
- Clicking a button opens a new window.
- Users enter problem inputs.
- The selected algorithm processes the input and displays the solution.

## Technologies
- C#
- .NET Framework
- Windows Forms

## Project Structure
- `OR` → Main Windows Forms project
- `simplex` → Simplex algorithm implementation
- `OR.sln` → Visual Studio solution file

## Notes
- This project is intended for educational and academic purposes.
- Algorithm logic is separated from UI where possible.

## Future Improvements
- Improve UI design
- Add charts for regression visualization
- Add unit tests for algorithms
- Export results to file
